                    <h3 id="‚öôÔ∏è-floating-panel">‚öôÔ∏è Floating Panel</h3>
                    <p>The <a target="_about" href="/A.C.A.S/app?shl=pip">Floating Panel</a> setting creates a small "<em>Picture-in-Picture</em>" view you can resize to be even smaller that will stay on top of every window. It contains important information about the current match.</p>
                    <p class="tip">This setting is very important to know for non-Firefox users because it stops A.C.A.S from freezing, and makes the engine run faster! Firefox users and those that do not want to use this can just create two browser windows next to each other, so that the A.C.A.S tab is visible, even if just a little bit, which also stops A.C.A.S tab from freezing.</p>

                    <h3 id="‚öôÔ∏è-chess-engine">‚öôÔ∏è Chess Engine</h3>
                    <p>The <a target="_about" href="/A.C.A.S/app?shl=chessEngine">Chess Engine</a> setting changes the engine which is used to calculate moves. We recommend using <strong>Stockfish 17 WASM</strong> as its the fastest and strongest engine, although it does not play like a human and has a hard time playing badly. If you want to play chess variants, use <strong>Fairy Stockfish 14</strong>. You can access Lc0 and Fairy Stockfish engines via the <code>?sab=true</code> URL parameter. It enables SharedArrayBuffer required by those engines.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stockfish &lt;17 (The strongest gameplay)</li>
                        <li>Fairy Stockfish 14 (Chess variants)</li>
                        <li>Lc0 with Maia (Semi-realistic human-like gameplay)</li>
                        <li>Lozza 5 (Quite strong engine-like gameplay)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="tip">A.C.A.S takes information from the engine's results to give you insights into the match. Some engines offer less of extra information which cannot then be analyzed. Use Stockfish for best results.</p>
                    <p>None of these engines will play like a human for you. Do not think you can get away playing 2500 elo matches as a 1000 elo player with an engine. We do not want to hear any complaining on why you got banned when you broke our ToS.</p>

                    <h3 id="‚öôÔ∏è-chess-variant">‚öôÔ∏è Chess Variant</h3>
                    <p class="tip">Most users do not play chess variants, <strong>you most likely do not need to change this nor the <a target="_about" href="/A.C.A.S/app?shl=useChess960">Chess 960</a></strong>. If you happen to play a variant, A.C.A.S should automatically detect the chess variant you're playing if its supported.</p>
                    <p>The <a target="_about" href="/A.C.A.S/app?shl=chessVariant">Chess Variant</a> setting changes the type of chess Fairy Stockfish plays. Other engines don‚Äôt really support it, but most do support <a target="_about" href="/A.C.A.S/app?shl=useChess960">Chess 960</a>, which is a variant of chess in which the piece starting positions are randomized. If you happen to play variants, you need to use Fairy Stockfish <a target="_about" href="/A.C.A.S/app?shl=chessEngine">Chess Engine</a>. You can access it via <code>?sab=true</code>.</p>
                    
                    <h3 id="‚öôÔ∏è-engine-elo">‚öôÔ∏è Engine Elo</h3>
                    <p>The <a target="_about" href="/A.C.A.S/app?shl=engineElo">Engine Elo</a> setting controls how strong the engine plays (between 500-3200 elo). Note that engines like Stockfish are <strong>very strong</strong>, playing way above human 3000 elo. For that reason, making them play at low elo (below 1500) might result in weird behaviour. Stockfish cannot really play extremely low elo (below 1000). Lc0 is better suited for that.</p><img alt="Chart displaying the ELO depending on the engine search depth and skill level." height="441" src="/A.C.A.S/assets/images/chart.png">
            
                    <h3 id="‚öôÔ∏è-weights">‚öôÔ∏è Weights</h3>
                    <p>The <a target="_about" href="/A.C.A.S/app?shl=lc0Weight">Lc0 Weights</a> setting determines how the Lc0 engine plays. The weight controls the engine's playing style, influencing the decisions it makes while playing. <strong>Maia weights</strong> have the elo they're roughly playing at marked on them. The elo and playing style of other weights is not known, but most of them are quite weak. You can access the Lc0 engine via <code>?sab=true</code>.</p>
                    <p class="tip">Most weights A.C.A.S has, Maia specifically, are designed to only use 1 search node. It's fine that it goes just to depth 1. Using more than 1 search node might cause weird behavior.</p>
                    
                    <h3 id="‚öôÔ∏è-moves-on-external-site">‚öôÔ∏è Moves On External Site</h3>
                    <p>The <a target="_about" href="/A.C.A.S/app?shl=displayMovesOnExternalSite">Moves On External Site</a> setting adds details about the move (<em>such has the arrow</em>) to the external site, which could be Chess.com for example, directly on the board you're playing on.</p>
                    <p class="tip">Chess sites <em>could</em> implement detections to this. Right now no site seems to detect it, but if you're extra worried, disable this, it doesn't matter if you're not following the engine moves.</p>

For clarity, fire emojis üî• indicate <strong>contested squares</strong> too. If two fire emojis are stacked it means there are 4 or 5 pieces attacking that square. 3 fire emojis stacked mean there are 6 or 7 pieces attacking that square, 4 fire emojis mean that 8 or 9 pieces are attacking it, and so fourth.</p>
                    <p>The fire emoji can have text, for example, üî• with -2 text means that the square is defended by 2 less pieces than the enemy attacks it with (e.g. you have 1 piece defending the square, the enemy has 3 pieces attacking it, so 1 - 3 = -2). +2 means that you have 2 more pieces attacking the specific square than the enemy does (e.g. you attack a square with 4 pieces and the enemy defends it with only 2, so 4 - 2 = 2).</p>
