### A.C.A.S GUI

#### Hosting on localhost

1) Install the A.C.A.S userscript.
2) Select a webserver of your choosing, e.g. [UwAmp](https://www.uwamp.com/en/).
3) Create a folder named `A.C.A.S` to the root folder of your webserver. (e.g. `www/A.C.A.S`)
4) Clone the repository and put the files inside the folder you just created.
6) You should now see A.C.A.S running on `http://localhost/A.C.A.S/`.
7) Make sure the A.C.A.S userscript is on and you should be good to go!

!> Make sure there are no additional folders which would make the URL like `http://localhost/A.C.A.S/A.C.A.S/`.

> You can use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to make Git actions such as cloning easy.

### A.C.A.S Userscript

Developing the userscript is easy, simply develop it as you'd any other userscripts.

!> Browsers might cache userscripts after you've refreshed the site enough times. If you notice your userscript being cached, disable the userscript, refresh the page, then enable the userscript and refresh the page again.
