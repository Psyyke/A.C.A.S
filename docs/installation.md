# Installation

Simply open the <a target="_about" href="app">GUI</a>, it will help you install A.C.A.S. More detailed information is below.

## Getting Started

1. Install a browser like [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or something based off it. Firefox and others should work too.
2. Install either [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) or [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/). You can find them on your browser's extension store too.
3. Install A.C.A.S from [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/459137-a-c-a-s-advanced-chess-assistance-system). If you don't like GreasyFork for some reason, you can also manually create a new userscript on the manager and then copy paste the code from `acas.user.js` there.
4. Open the <a target="_about" href="app">GUI</a>. Follow the instructions.
5. Open a supported chess site on **another browser window next to the GUI** and start playing.
    - Alternatively, enable the <a target="_about" href="app?shl=pip">Floating Panel</a> setting to prevent the GUI from freezing.

!> Keep the A.C.A.S GUI tab active to keep the whole system functional. Think of the tab as an engine of a car, the userscript alone is simply an empty hull, it won't move. The GUI has the chess engine, it calculates the moves! Either make two browser windows next to each other or use the <a target="_about" href="app?shl=pip">Floating Panel</a> setting.

## Mobile Users

Following the [Getting Started](#getting-started) guide, you might notice that your regular mobile browser doesn't support extensions. Don't worry, there are browsers for mobile that support extensions which you can use to follow the first step of the [Getting Started](#getting-started) guide.

1. Install a browser app which supports a userscript manager.
    - **Android** users can use [Lemur Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lemurbrowser.exts) with [Violentmonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag).
    - **iOS** users can use Safari with the [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887) extension.
2. Follow the [Getting Started](#getting-started) guide found above.
3. Make sure to enable  <a target="_about" href="app?shl=pip">Floating Panel</a> setting to prevent freezing.

Note that you need to play games in the browser. For example, A.C.A.S won’t work in the Chess app. It functions the same way as on a desktop, but the challenge is finding a browser that supports extensions like Violentmonkey. We’ve recommended a few options above.

!>**Both users** should enable the <a target="_about" href="app?shl=pip">Floating Panel</a> setting to prevent A.C.A.S freezing and not giving suggestions. Every time you start A.C.A.S, make sure to click the A.C.A.S page once to open the <a target="_about" href="app?shl=pip">Floating Panel</a>! The panel needs to be visible in order to stop freezing.
