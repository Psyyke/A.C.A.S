            <div class="big-title gradient-text">Why was A.C.A.S made?</div>

            <div class="small-paragraph extra-slim greyed">"<i>Why the hell did you create that cheating tool, you absolute jerk?! You've completely wrecked the game for everyone involved.</i>" If you recognized yourself, this is for you.</div>

            <div class="paragraph slim">The decision to create a cheat wasn't about trying to cheat the system or gain an unfair advantage over others. It came from a place of genuine curiosity. Sometimes, exploring unconventional learning methods, like creating cheats, can help us push our boundaries, foster innovation, and speed up our learning process.</div>
            <div class="paragraph slim">I simply find making cheats fun and rewarding. It satisfies the problem-solving need and brings a unique sense of satisfaction. Humans are naturally curious beings, driven by a desire to explore, understand, and push boundaries. Forbidden things are simply more tempting, and therefore making a cheat is extremely satisfying and a good motivator to push through and learn more about topics that would otherwise bore you.</div>
            <div class="paragraph slim">I must acknowledge the ethical concerns surrounding cheating. I'm fully aware of the harm it can cause to others and the importance of maintaining integrity. Throughout my journey, I've remained committed to using the cheat responsibly and ensuring that its use doesn't compromise fairness or harm anyone in any way. I hope others do the same.</div>
            <div class="paragraph slim">The cheat has been a tool for personal growth, helping me deepen my knowledge, challenge myself, and cultivate a genuine passion for programming. Remember to differentiate between making a cheat and cheating itself. Please don't send any hate towards A.C.A.S, it will not solve anything. Cheating on chess has existed long before A.C.A.S, and will exist long after its gone.</div>

            <div class="paragraph slim">I hope you understand.</div>
