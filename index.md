## Hindsight is Overrated

You know that feeling when you finish a game, check the analysis, and realize you’re complete dogsht* at chess? Like nah bro, what was that, how is 9 missed wins even possible?? I should just quit, pack it up, and never play again... if GothamChess sees my match, his next video wouldn't be from his home but a damn hospital bed... Nahhh 😭🙏
